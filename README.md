Okay so
If you are reading this you are confused
This is my machone learning library for my

CREATIVE
ENRICHMENT
PROJECT

in compsci!!!
thing is, i just pushed some NN code using
Numjs (mad props to the guys who made it)
cuz i need ez acces to it for the proj.
Anywho, if you are actually curious about the library
stay tuned, im developping it but more so towards the
end of the school year

for my real fans out there, there's some changes:
    --> New dep(s) : Numjs (any version)
    --> Soon to be removed Matrix code, because NumJs
    --> Shout out to Teminite and the guys who made NumJs
    --> Also Git stopped working on another project because
        of merge errors so Im typing this all in vim rather 
        than the Github Website for fear of more merge errors.
thanks and yes, I really got lucky to steal the package name (njml, nodejsML)
